# Staging area: Where files go that are ready to be committed (after running "add")

- git diff: Shows diff between current working directory and staging area
- git diff --staged: Shows diff between staging area and last commit so you can see how committing added files will change the repository
- git diff <file_name>: Shows diff between current working directory for that specific file and staging area.
